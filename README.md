## LISER 

**Purpose:**

This Github organization contains repositories made by researchers, postdocs and PhD students at LISER. 
The objectives of this Github organization are: 
* collaborate and share code for a given dataset or project (e.g. [`OJV`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/OJV),[`ChatGPT`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/ChatGPT))
  * the idea is when someone works with a new dataset then they should not reinvent the wheel  if someone already did that (rather focus on improving the previous work).
* centralize all the information and links to relevant resources (e.g. [`Datasets-and-Methods`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets-and-Methods)) 
* collect information about skills of current and past people at LISER, in order to find the right person to ask, foster more collaboration, create new and better ideas (e.g. [`Datasets-and-Methods`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets-and-Methods)) 

**General Rules for Repositories:**
* by default, create only private repositories (i.e. restricted to LISER) - so don't fear to experiment and make mistakes (learning by doing, is the way to go :blush:)
* to make a private repository go public, it is necessary to contact one of the Owners/Administrators (Adam, Terry or Etienne) in order to check if there is no sensitive data

**To do list for each LISER member:**
 1. Add information in excel about the Methods and Softwares you "used/are using/plan to use" ([`Datasets-and-Methods`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets-and-Methods))
 2. Share code (parts or all) from your past/current research that can be useful for others ("data cleaning", "descriptive stats")
    * To do so, create (if one there is none) repository titled with the name of the dataset used (or project)
