## LISER 

This Github organization contains repositories made by researchers, postdocs and PhD students at LISER. 
The objectives of this Github organization are: 
* collaborate and share code
* centralize all the information and links to relevant resources (e.g. methods and datasets) 

The repository [`Datasets-and-Methods`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets-and-Methods) contains:

* a list of datasets that are or were used at LISER,
* a list of methods (NLP, spatial econometrics, GIS, etc.) for which there are some code in at least one of the repositories.

For each of these datasets/methods, there's an accompanying link that will show all the repositories that use them so that you quickly know where to search.
