## LISER 

This Github organization contains repositories made by researchers, postdocs and PhD students at LISER. The objective is to make it easier to share code for complicated tasks, either during the data cleaning or during the analysis. 

The repository `Datasets-and-Methods` contains:

* a list of datasets that are or were used at LISER,
* a list of methods (NLP, spatial econometrics, GIS, etc.) for which there are some code in at least one of the repositories.

For each of these datasets/methods, there's an accompanying link that will show all the repositories that use them so that you quickly know where to search.
