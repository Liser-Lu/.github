## LISER 

This Github organization contains repositories made by researchers, postdocs and PhD students at LISER. 
The objectives of this Github organization are: 
* collaborate and share code for a given dataset or projec (e.g. [`OJV`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/OJV))
* *s 
* centralize all the information and links to relevant resources (e.g. [`Datasets-and-Methods`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets-and-Methods)) 
* collect information about skills of current and past people at LISER, in order to find the right person to ask, foster more collaboration, create new and better ideas (e.g. [`Datasets-and-Methods`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets-and-Methods)) 

**General rules:**
* by default, create only private repositories (i.e. restricted to LISER) - so don't fear to experiment and make mistakes (learning by doing, is the way to go :blush:)
* to make a private repository go public, it is necessary to contact one of the Owners/Administrators (Adam, Terry or Etienne) in order to check if there is no sensitive data
