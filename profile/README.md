## LISER 

This Github organization contains repositories made by researchers, postdocs and PhD students at LISER. 
The objectives of this Github organization are: 
* collaborate and share code for a given dataset or project (e.g. [`OJV`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/OJV))
  * the idea is when someone works with a new dataset then they should not reinvent the wheel  if someone already did that (rather focus on improving the previous work).
  * One script can be on "data cleaning" and another script can be on "descriptive stats".
* centralize all the information and links to relevant resources (e.g. [`Datasets-and-Methods`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets-and-Methods)) 
* collect information about skills of current and past people at LISER, in order to find the right person to ask, foster more collaboration, create new and better ideas (e.g. [`Datasets-and-Methods`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets-and-Methods)) 

**General Rules for Repositories:**
* by default, create only private repositories (i.e. restricted to LISER) - so don't fear to experiment and make mistakes (learning by doing, is the way to go :blush:)
* to make a private repository go public, it is necessary to contact one of the Owners/Administrators (Adam, Terry or Etienne) in order to check if there is no sensitive data

**To do list for each LISER member:**
1. Add information about the Methods and Softwares you "used/are using/plan to use"
2. Share code (parts or all) from your past/current research that can be useful for others ("data cleaning", "descriptive stats")
  2.1. To do so, create (if one there is none) repository titled with the name of the dataset used (or project), and share parts of your code that can be of use to others
