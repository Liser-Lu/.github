## LISER 

**Purpose:**

This Github organization contains repositories made by researchers, postdocs and PhD students at LISER. 
The objectives of this Github organization are: 
* collaborate and share code for a given dataset or project (e.g. see repository [`OJV`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/OJV),[`ChatGPT`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/ChatGPT))
  * the idea is when someone works with a new dataset then they should not reinvent the wheel  if someone already did that (rather focus on improving the previous work).
* centralize all the information and links to relevant resources (e.g. see repository [`Datasets_MethodsAndSoftwares_Code`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets_MethodsAndSoftwares_Code)) 
* collect information about skills of current and past people at LISER, in order to find the right person to ask, foster more collaboration, create new and better ideas (e.g. see repository [`Datasets_MethodsAndSoftwares_Code`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets_MethodsAndSoftwares_Code)) 

**To do list for each LISER member:**
 1. Add information in excel about the Datasets, Methods and Softwares you "used/are using/plan to use" ([see repository `Datasets_MethodsAndSoftwares_Code`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets_MethodsAndSoftwares_Code))
 2. Share code (parts or all) from your past/current research that can be useful for others ("data cleaning", "descriptive stats")
    * To do so, create (if one there is none) repository titled with the name of the dataset used (or project)

**General Rules for Repositories:**
* by default, create only private repositories (i.e. restricted to LISER) - so don't fear to experiment and make mistakes (learning by doing, is the way to go :blush:)
* to make a private repository go public, it is necessary to contact one of the Owners/Administrators (Adam, Terry or Etienne) in order to check if there is no sensitive data
