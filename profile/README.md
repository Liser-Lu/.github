## LISER 

This GitHub organization hosts repositories created by LISER researchers, postdocs, and PhD students. 

**Purpose:**
* Collaborate and share code for datasets or projects, reducing duplication and encouraging improvement (e.g., when someone works with a new dataset then they should not reinvent the wheel by cleaning it again, but rather focus on improving the previous work);
* Centralize information and links to relevant resources (e.g., datasets);
* Collect information about the skills of current and past LISER members to foster collaboration and generate new ideas.

**General Repository Rules:**
* By default, repositories are private and restricted to LISER members, allowing for experimentation and learning;
* Contact Owners/Administrators (Adam, Terry, or Etienne) to make a private repository public if there is no sensitive data.

**Action Steps for each LISER member:**
 1.	Add information to the Excel sheet about the datasets, methods, and software you've used, are using, or plan to use (Visit the [`Datasets_MethodsAndSoftwares_Code`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Datasets_MethodsAndSoftwares) repository);
 2. Share code from your research, such as data cleaning and descriptive stats, by creating a repository named after the dataset or project). Need help? Take a look at the [`Getting Started`](https://github.com/Liser-Lu/Getting-started) repository.
